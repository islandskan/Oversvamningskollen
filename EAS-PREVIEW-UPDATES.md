# Important Updates to EAS Preview Build Documentation

## Critical Prebuild Step Added

We've updated all documentation to include the crucial prebuild step that was previously missing. This step is essential before creating EAS builds.

### What is Prebuilding?

Prebuilding generates the native iOS and Android project files from your JavaScript/TypeScript Expo project. This step:

1. Creates the iOS and Android native project directories
2. Configures native dependencies based on your JavaScript project
3. Sets up the necessary native code for your Expo modules

### Why is Prebuilding Necessary?

EAS Build needs these native project files to create your app builds. Without prebuilding:
- The build process will fail
- You'll get errors about missing native files
- The EAS build service won't have the necessary configuration to create your app

### Updated Documentation

We've updated all documentation files to include this step:

1. **EAS-PREVIEW-GUIDE.md**: Added Section 2 on prebuilding
2. **EAS-PREVIEW-TUTORIAL.md**: Added Step 2 for prebuilding
3. **EAS-PREVIEW-VISUAL-GUIDE.md**: Added Section 2 with visual examples
4. **README-EAS-PREVIEW.md**: Updated Quick Start section

## Complete Process Overview

The complete process for creating EAS preview builds now includes:

1. **Configure your project**:
   - Set up your `eas.json` file with the necessary configurations
   - Install `expo-dev-client` for development capabilities

2. **Prebuild native projects**:
   ```bash
   # Prebuild for both platforms
   npx expo prebuild
   
   # Or prebuild for specific platforms
   npx expo prebuild --platform android
   npx expo prebuild --platform ios
   ```

3. **Create preview builds**:
   ```bash
   # For Android
   eas build --profile preview-android --platform android

   # For iOS
   eas build --profile preview-ios --platform ios
   ```

4. **Access QR codes**:
   ```bash
   # List builds
   eas build:list

   # View a specific build (includes QR code)
   eas build:view [BUILD_ID]
   ```

5. **Push updates**:
   ```bash
   # After making changes to your app
   eas update --channel preview
   ```

## Next Steps

Now that the documentation is complete, you can follow the steps in the updated guides to create and distribute your preview builds with QR codes.
